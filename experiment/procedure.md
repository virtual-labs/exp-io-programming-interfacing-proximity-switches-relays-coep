##  Procedure

1. Connect the relay control pin (IN) to Digital Pin 11 on the Arduino.
2. Connect the relay VCC to 5V and GND to GND of Arduino.
3. On the output side of the relay, connect an LED and resistor in series between NO and COM terminals.
4. Power the Arduino via USB or external power.
5. Upload the above code to the Arduino Uno using Arduino IDE.
6. Observe the LED switching ON and OFF every 1 second, indicating relay operation.
