##  Procedure

#### Configuration
- Select input Pin For the sensor
- Select output Pin For for the DC Motor
- Select the Sensor Type (Inductive or Capacitive)
- Select object material
- Click on "GENERATE CODE" button to generate code
- Click on "COMPILE" button to compile code
- Click on "EXECUTE" button to execute code and goto mimic
- If you want to download code click on "DOWNLOAD" button
- The MIMIC will open on left side of screen

#### Simulation
- Connect the Output Pin from the Arduino to the transistor by click on the connecting points
- Connect the selected Input Pin from the Arduino to the sensor by click on the connecting points
- Connect the relay and DC motor according to the circuit diagram by click on the connecting points
- Connect the relay and power supply according to the circuit diagram by click on the connecting points
- Click on "Check Connection" to validate the circuit connections
- If connections are shows wrong then you can click on the particular connected line to delete the wrong connection (wrong connection shows in RED color)
- After completion of circuit click on check connection object will displayed in front of sensor
- Click on "Plus" and "Minus" buttons  for movement the object 
- When object reached in between the sensing range of the sensor then current will flows through the circuit and motor starts running 
- Observe the changes in circuit and rotation of motor while changing the position of object from sensor 
- Click on "Next Level" button for next steps 

#### Questions
- Read all the questions carefully and submit the answer
- After submission, "Result" page will displayed
