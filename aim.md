## Aim
Interface a proximity sensor (Inductive or Capacitive) with an Arduino Uno to detect the presence of an object and use that signal to control a 12 V DC motor through a 5 V relay.

## Objectives 
-	Understand the working principles of Inductive and Capacitive proximity sensors.
-	Learn to interface an NPN proximity sensor with an Arduino Uno using a pull-up resistor.
-	Understand the function of an NPN transistor as a relay driver and the importance of a flyback diode.
-	Learn to connect and control a high-power DC motor using a low-power Arduino via a relay.
-	Program the Arduino to read sensor input and respond by controlling the DC motor accordingly.
